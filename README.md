439.200 is assigned for digital simplex operation.

<b>UHF CB Channels.</b> Note that these radios are not type approved for UHF CB transmision. These frequencies are included in Receive-only mode.

- MD390 with GPS and new vocoder
- MD380 with GPS and new vocoder

All editing was conducted with G6AMU's codeplug editor. The codeplug was uploaded to each test transceiver using TYT's CPS software "MD-380G WO GPS v1.36".
